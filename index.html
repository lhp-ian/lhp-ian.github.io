          <p>
            For visually impaired individuals, assistive navigation systems play a crucial role in enabling independent mobility.
            However, long-horizon planning based on natural language (NL) instructions in complex indoor environments remains a significant challenge.
            Recent studies show the strong potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in NL understanding and task-level planning.
            Yet, the inherent limitations of LLMs in mathematical reasoning and their susceptibility to hallucination hinder their reliability in low-level path planning.
            In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based indoor assistive navigation system that interprets NL instructions from visually impaired users for autonomous navigation.
            At its core is a novel planning agent that grounds instructions to the environment's topological map and generates optimal route plans.
            To avoid hallucination in geometric reasoning, the LLM handles only high-level semantic planning, while precise node-level paths are delegated to a classical graph search algorithm.
            We further implement a wearable assistive device that provides voice and vibrotactile feedback to deliver hands-free navigation.
            Offline evaluations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system can reliably plan grounded routes and enable visually impaired users to autonomously complete long-horizon navigation tasks.

            An external planner is employed to complement the LLM's limited mathematical reasoning. Diverse candidate 
            plans are generated first, and the optimal one is then selected by an auxiliary LLM, which also performs 
            feedback-driven refinement when necessary.
